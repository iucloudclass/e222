# REST API Lab

## Introduction to the Lab: Environment
- Typically we would recommend Ubuntu 17 for this Lab, but presently they have some issues. Before they are not resolved, we recommend Ubuntu 16.04 as the operating system for the labs.
- To not affect your existing OS on your laptop or workstation, we recommend that you use a virtual machine via VirtualBox
